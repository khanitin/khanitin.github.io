excerpt: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability worldwide, but its neural bases remain poorly understood. This study used multimodal fusion and machine learning to uncover structural and functional network disruptions that classify depression.

  Despite major depressive disorder (MDD) being the leading cause of disability worldwide, the exact characterization of its neural bases and the development of reliable biomarkers are still at an early stage. We employed a data fusion unsupervised machine learning method—transposed Independent Vector Analysis (tIVA)—to investigate joint functional and structural brain networks for MDD classification. Using amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and gray matter density (GMD) data from 461 participants (MDD = 226, HC = 235), we identified multimodal links between reduced functional activity in the cerebellum and structural deficits in subcortical regions (notably anterior cingulate cortex and insula) critical for emotional regulation. At the same time, dorsomedial prefrontal hyperactivity (DMN) and dorsolateral prefrontal hypoactivity (CEN) emerged as modality-unique alterations. A Random Forest classifier validated these features and achieved 69.9% accuracy in distinguishing MDD from healthy controls. These results highlight the role of fronto-insular and cerebellar alterations as multimodal biomarkers of depression and suggest that combining structural and functional neuroimaging enhances diagnostic precision, advancing precision psychiatry.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent and debilitating psychiatric conditions. This study applied a novel multimodal fusion method (tIVA) to integrate resting-state fMRI (ALFF) and structural MRI (gray matter density) in 461 participants. The findings revealed a joint disruption linking **cerebellar hypoactivity** and **salience network structural deficits**, alongside **default mode hyperactivity** and **executive control network hypoactivity** as unique features of MDD. A machine learning Random Forest model achieved nearly 70% classification accuracy, confirming the predictive value of these multimodal components. By uncovering structural–functional interactions in key networks, this work advances the search for neurobiological biomarkers of depression and informs precision psychiatry approaches.
