  Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is increasingly recognized as a critical stage for early intervention in cognitive decline. Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) is an evidence-based psychosocial intervention that has demonstrated positive effects in dementia but remains underexplored in MCI populations, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. This study presents a protocol for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating a novel tablet- and group-based adaptation of CST for older adults with MCI in Thailand. The intervention integrates traditional CST principles with computerized cognitive training, multisensory stimulation, and culturally adapted content to improve cognitive functions, emotional well-being, and quality of life. A total of 90 participants will be randomized into three arms: (1) Multicomponent CST (MCST: tablet + group sessions), (2) Standard CST (group sessions only), and (3) Control (treatment as usual). Outcomes will include neuropsychological tests, electroencephalography/event-related potentials (EEG/ERP), and psychosocial measures, assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up. This RCT will provide preliminary evidence on the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of technology-supported CST in a Thai cultural context, potentially informing scalable interventions for aging populations.
