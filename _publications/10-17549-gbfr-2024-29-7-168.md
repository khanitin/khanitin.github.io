excerpt: This study examines how trust mediates the effects of e-payment and blockchain on Logistics 4.0 and supply chain capabilities in Thailand, using a structural equation modeling approach with logistics managers and executives.
abstract: >
  This study investigates the relationships among e-payment, blockchain, trust, Logistics 4.0 capabilities, and supply chain capabilities in Thailand. Survey data from 205 logistics managers/executives were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results show that e-payment positively influences supply chain capabilities and trust but does not directly affect Logistics 4.0 capabilities. Blockchain directly fosters trust, which in turn positively impacts both Logistics 4.0 and supply chain capabilities. Trust mediates the effects of both e-payment and blockchain on these capabilities, underscoring its central role in transparency, coordination, and operational efficiency. Model fit indices indicated excellent fit (e.g., CFI ≈ .99; RMSEA ≈ .03), and explained variance was substantial (R² ≈ .36 for trust, .40 for Logistics 4.0 capabilities, .57 for supply chain capabilities). Findings highlight the importance of secure payment infrastructures and blockchain-enabled transparency to build trust and enhance logistics/supply chain performance in Thailand.
