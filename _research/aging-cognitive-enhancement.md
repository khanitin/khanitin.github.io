### Research questions
Whether and how advanced technology can improve cognition and emotion in older adults, and what neural mechanisms underlie these changes. 

### Methodology
the above questions extend beyond testing efficacy to probing mechanisms (EEG/ERP), emotional outcomes, and the broader applicability of cognitive enhancement approaches.


### Recent study
My project, “Development of Computerized Multicomponent Cognitive Stimulation for Improving Cognitive Functions in Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI): A Multimodal Investigation Using Neuropsychological and EEG/ERP Assessment,” is guided by several overarching research questions.

First, I ask whether a computerized multicomponent cognitive stimulation (CMCS) program can enhance cognitive functions in older adults with MCI beyond what is achieved through traditional computerized CST. This question focuses on the effectiveness of my novel intervention by comparing outcomes in memory, language, visuospatial skills, executive functioning, and psychomotor performance across MCST, CST, and control groups. The aim is to connect these findings with the broader goal of creating scalable, technology-driven tools to slow cognitive decline and reduce the risk of dementia.

Second, I investigate how integrating multisensory stimulation into CST contributes to improvements in both cognition and emotion. By embedding multisensory tasks such as the sound-induced flash illusion, I explore whether engaging multiple sensory modalities produces broader or stronger benefits than unimodal training. This line of questioning builds on evidence of the neuroplastic advantages of multisensory integration in aging brains and highlights its potential for improving both engagement and transfer of training effects.

Third, I examine the neurophysiological correlates of cognitive enhancement induced by CMCS. In particular, I investigate whether EEG/ERP markers, including theta power and P3 amplitude/latency, reflect training-induced neural efficiency and plasticity. This approach allows me to link behavioral improvements to objective brain-based evidence, thereby strengthening the mechanistic understanding of why and how the intervention works.

Fourth, I ask whether CMCS alleviates emotional distress, specifically symptoms of depression and anxiety, in older adults with MCI. Beyond cognitive outcomes, this question addresses the potential of such interventions to support emotional well-being, which is especially important given that affective symptoms can accelerate cognitive decline. In doing so, my work expands into a more holistic model of cognitive–emotional health in aging.

Finally, I consider the limitations and boundaries of CMCS benefits. My results suggest that while cognitive and emotional improvements were significant, there were no measurable changes in quality of life. This raises an important question about which domains are most responsive to computerized training and which may require additional or complementary interventions—whether social, behavioral, or lifestyle-based—to achieve meaningful changes in everyday functioning.
