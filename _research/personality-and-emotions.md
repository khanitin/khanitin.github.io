title: "Personality, Emotions, and Well-being"
layout: researchdetail
category: personality
excerpt: "How emotion, personality, and well-being form mutually reinforcing systems, studied through affective neuroscience. By examining the neural mechanisms of emotional processing, regulation, and reactivity, you provide a mechanistic bridge that explains how personality traits and emotional tendencies shape well-being and why these tendencies are stable across individuals."

### Research questions
My research question explores the intersection of personality psychology, affective neuroscience, and well-being by examining how emotions and their underlying neural mechanisms shape, and are shaped by, stable personality traits. Personality traits influence emotional reactivity and regulation, while recurrent emotional states and regulation strategies, in turn, reinforce these traits and impact subjective well-being over time. From an affective neuroscience perspective, emotion- and well-being-related brain circuits—including the amygdala, striatum, insula, anterior cingulate, and prefrontal cortex—provide mechanistic insights into why individuals differ in personality expression and well-being outcomes. 

### Methodology
By investigating these links with tools like EEG/ERP, MRI/fMRI, or network analysis, my work bridges descriptive trait models with neural and well-being mechanisms, offering a deeper understanding of how personality is embedded in emotional processes and how both together influence well-being.
