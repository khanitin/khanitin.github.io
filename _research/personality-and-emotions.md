title: "Personality and emotions"
layout: researchdetail
category: personality
excerpt: "How emotion and personality are mutually reinforcing systems, studied through affective neuroscience. By examining the neural mechanisms of emotional processing, regulation, and reactivity, you provide a mechanistic bridge that explains how personality traits manifest in the brain and why emotional tendencies are stable across individuals."

### Research questions
My research question explores the intersection of personality psychology and affective neuroscience by examining how emotions and their underlying neural mechanisms shape, and are shaped by, stable personality traits. Personality traits influence emotional reactivity and regulation, while recurrent emotional states and regulation strategies, in turn, reinforce these traits over time. From an affective neuroscience perspective, emotion-related brain circuits—including the amygdala, striatum, insula, anterior cingulate, and prefrontal cortex—provide mechanistic insights into why individuals differ in personality expression. 

### Methodology
By investigating these links with tools like EEG/ERP, MRI/fMRI, or network analysis, my work bridges descriptive trait models with neural mechanisms, offering a deeper understanding of how personality is embedded in and expressed through emotional processes.
